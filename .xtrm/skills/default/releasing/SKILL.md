  Cut a release end-to-end. Promotes the existing [Unreleased] CHANGELOG block
  to a dated [vX.Y.Z] section, bumps the version (if the repo has a version
  manifest), rebuilds (if there's a build step), commits, tags, pushes, and
  publishes to a package registry (if the repo publishes one). Works for npm
  and non-npm repos alike.

# releasing

End-to-end release skill. Drives the release directly with bash; no `xt release`
wrapper. Expects `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` to be either populated by the
`session-close-report` skill (Step 6) across the contributing sessions, or — on a
`/setup-git-cliff` repo — an empty placeholder that the release step generates
from the git log.

## When to use

The operator says "release it", "ship vX.Y.Z", "cut a tag", or just "release".

## Preconditions

- Run the global-surface smoke container before publishing and again after. It is the only gate
  that checks what the packages install into a user's HOME, and nothing runs it for you. Commands
  and the expected pre-release failure: `docs/release.md`, "Global-surface smoke container".

- Working tree clean except whitelisted release artifacts.
- `CHANGELOG.md` exists with an `[Unreleased]` block.
- On the publish branch (usually `master`).
- If this repo publishes to a package registry, registry auth is set up
  (e.g. `npm whoami` succeeds).

If the project has no `CHANGELOG.md`, stop and ask the operator.

## Flow

### 1. Decide version

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -3        # last release
git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline | wc -l # commit count since
```

Default is patch bump. Operator may say `--minor`, `--major`, or specify
`vX.Y.Z` explicitly. If the in-range work added user-facing surface (new flags,
new endpoints, new commands), bump minor unless operator says otherwise.

### 2. Inspect [Unreleased]

```bash
sed -n '/## \[Unreleased\]/,/## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md
```

Decision:

- **Populated and complete** (covers the user-facing changes since last tag):
  proceed to Step 3.
- **Empty, and this repo runs the git-cliff pipeline** (`changelog/cliff.toml` +
  `scripts/changelog-update.mjs` — see `/setup-git-cliff`): that is the expected
  state, not a gap. The block is a placeholder on purpose — a per-branch block
  makes every merge conflict every other open pull request. Run
  `node scripts/changelog-update.mjs --preview` to see what the release will
  contain, then proceed to Step 3; the `--tag` run generates the section from
  the git log.
- **Empty, stale, or gappy, and this repo does NOT run git-cliff**: dispatch
  `/setup-git-cliff` to install the pipeline, run the updater, then
  re-inspect. Hand-writing bullets from `git log <last-tag>..HEAD` is a
  one-off fallback only — prefer fixing it with the pipeline so the next
  release doesn't hit the same gap.
- **Empty** because commits since last tag are pure-internal (refactors,
  doc-only): proceed; the released section will be near-empty.

### 3. Promote [Unreleased] → [vX.Y.Z]

Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:

- Insert a new empty `## [Unreleased]` block at the top.
- Rename the previous `[Unreleased]` to `## [vX.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` (today's
  date).
- Keep the section bodies (Added / Changed / Fixed / etc.) untouched.
- If this repo runs the git-cliff pipeline (`changelog/cliff.toml` +
  `scripts/changelog-update.mjs` — see `/setup-git-cliff`), do not hand-promote:
  `node scripts/changelog-update.mjs --tag vX.Y.Z` writes the whole section from
  the git log and leaves an empty `[Unreleased]` above it. `npm version` runs it
  for you. The generated bullets are per-commit and terse — draft a short prose
  summary — one paragraph, or one per major theme if the release spans
  several — of the release's main takeaways, and insert it directly under
  the version heading, above the categorized groups. Ground it in the
  bullets and commits already in the section; don't invent scope that
  isn't there.

### 4. Bump version (if this repo has a version manifest)

```bash
# npm:    package.json "version", package-lock.json (top + packages[""])
# Rust:   Cargo.toml "version" (+ Cargo.lock if it pins the workspace member)
# Python: pyproject.toml "version" (or a bare VERSION file)
```

Edit whatever manifest(s) this repo actually tracks. If the version lives
only in the git tag — no manifest — skip this step entirely.

### 5. Build (if this repo has a build step)

```bash
npm run build   # or this repo's equivalent, e.g. cargo build --release
git status --short
```

Tracked build output may or may not change (often byte-identical when HEAD
already had a fresh build). Skip entirely if nothing is built/tracked.

### 6. Verify release scope

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
```

Allowed paths only:

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- the version manifest(s) touched in Step 4 (if any)
- built artifacts touched in Step 5 (if tracked)

Anything else dirty → stop, fix scope, retry. Stash unrelated untracked files
(e.g. downstream specialist leakage in `.specialists/user/`) before continuing.

### 7. Commit, tag, push

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md <version manifest(s) from Step 4> <build artifacts from Step 5>  # only what's tracked and touched
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin <branch>
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### 8. Publish (if this repo publishes to a registry)

```bash
npm publish --access public    # --access public for scoped packages
# or this repo's equivalent: cargo publish, twine upload, etc.
```

Skip entirely for repos that only ship via git tags (internal tools, apps).

### 9. Refresh global toolchain

If this project ships a CLI the operator uses globally:

```bash
npm i -g <package>@X.Y.Z   # or this repo's equivalent global-install command
<cli> --version
```

### 10. Confirm

```bash
git tag --list 'v*' | tail -3
git log --oneline -1
git status --short
npm view <package> version   # only if published in Step 8
```

### 11. Optional: GitHub release

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes "$(sed -n '/## \[vX.Y.Z\]/,/## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)"
```

## Why this design

- `session-close-report` already drafts user-facing prose per session and
  appends to `[Unreleased]` (Step 6 of that skill). The release-time work is
  therefore small: promote, bump, build, commit, tag, push, publish.
- For repos on the `/setup-git-cliff` pipeline, `[Unreleased]` bullets come
  from `git-cliff` per-commit instead — accurate but terse. Step 3 adds a
  short prose highlights paragraph at promotion time so the changelog still
  reads as a narrative, not just a flat commit list.
- Keeping the deterministic mutations in bash (driven by this skill) avoids
  three failure modes seen with the old `xt release` wrapper: hardcoded
  workspace paths, wrong specialist invocation, and a regex template engine
  that over-greedy-matches `$VAR` patterns inside report prose.
- The `changelog-keeper` specialist dispatch is retired: `/setup-git-cliff`
  regenerates `[Unreleased]` deterministically from the git log, which is
  strictly more reliable than reconciling gaps from xt reports by hand.
- Version bump, build, and publish are each conditional on this repo actually
  having a version manifest, build step, or registry to publish to — an
  internal tool or docs-only repo can go straight from promote to tag/push.

## Parallel sessions

Two operators racing the same version: first `git push origin vX.Y.Z` wins;
second sees a non-fast-forward / tag-exists error and aborts. Operator picks
the next version and retries.

## Don't

- Don't call `xt release prepare` / `xt release publish` — retired. See
  `unitAI-g29jv`.
- Don't broaden the release diff with source/docs/config changes. File a
  separate bead.
- Don't pre-stage unrelated files. The release scope check should see a clean
  tree except whitelisted release artifacts.
- Don't invent CHANGELOG entries from `git log -p`. The reports + existing
  `[Unreleased]` are the input.
- Don't `git push --force` or rewrite tags. If a release ships wrong, cut a
  patch.
