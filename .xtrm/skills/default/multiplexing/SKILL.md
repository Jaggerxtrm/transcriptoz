# Multiplexing

You are an orchestration assistant for an operator working in N concurrent tmux sessions (Claude Code, pi, raw shell, vim, REPL). Inventory, hand off, monitor, clean up, recover. You do not run a new harness. You do not replace specialists. The operator may switch agents at any time.

Invoked explicitly via `/multiplexing`. Auto-activation is unreliable across harnesses — do not assume it fires.

> **Before starting, run `xtmux --help` and `xt --help` (also `xtmux <subcommand> --help`, `xt <subcommand> --help`).** This skill carries policy and the shapes that matter for correctness. The CLI is authoritative for the current command/flag surface — check it whenever you need exact syntax rather than relying on remembered forms.

## Slash-syntax gotcha — pi and claude differ

The most common mistake in this skill: sending `/skill:multiplexing` to a Claude worker. Claude treats it as literal user text and the skill never loads.

| Runtime | Slash form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/<name>` | `/multiplexing`, `/using-specialists` |
| Pi          | `/skill:<name>` | `/skill:multiplexing`, `/skill:using-specialists` |

This applies wherever a skill is loaded turn-1 via `--prompt` or is sent as a pointer via `send-keys` / `safe-send-pointer`. `--skill <name>` on either runtime is fine; combining `--skill <name>` with a leading `/<name>` in `--prompt` on Claude Code resolves twice — pick one channel.

## Authority boundary

- **Own**: inventory, assisted handoffs, cleanup hygiene, messy-run recovery, session naming convention.
- **Do not own**: specialist chain orchestration (→ `/using-specialists`), delegated-pane self-protocol (→ `/multiplexing-team`), spawn primitives (Docker/VM/subprocess), custom IPC schemas (beads already serve comms), tool-specific harness bindings.

## When it applies vs when it doesn't

Applies: inventory across sessions, delegation to another session, cleanup (dead sessions, orphan processes, leaked worktrees), recovery from a messy delegated agent, coordinated multi-session goal, sprint orchestration.

Does NOT apply: specialist chain orchestration → `/using-specialists`. Delegated pane's self-protocol → the pane loads `/multiplexing-team`. Designing a new agent runtime → out of scope. In-process subagent spawn (Claude Agent SDK, Cline, Cursor) → out of scope; stays tool-agnostic. Single-session deep work → no multiplexing needed.

## Cardinal rules — non-negotiable

1. **Never multi-line paste via `send-keys`.** Each `\n` is an Enter — the target receives N fragmented prompts.
2. **Never use `$(...)` or backticks** inside `send-keys` — shell expansion injects into the pane.
3. **Never `tmux paste-buffer`** with a file that contains newlines. Same fragmentation as rule 1.
4. **Never send a prompt while the target pane is in Working state.** It queues, fragments, or races in-flight output.
5. **Never invent ad-hoc session names.** Follow the naming convention below.

## Communication primitives — beads first, /tmp second, send-keys third

- **Beads (`bd`)**: canonical durable comms. Task content + status + findings survive session death, harness restart, agent switch. Default to beads for anything worth surviving a crash. Beads are already the operator's message bus; do not invent a fourth channel.
- **`/tmp/<session>-<topic>.txt`**: ephemeral meta-protocol (negative constraints, output shape, one-off scope clarifications). Write via Bash heredoc, NOT the Write tool (Write is blocked by the bd claim gate in beads-managed repos).
- **`send-keys`**: single-line pointer only. Three allowed forms — (a) read pointer `'leggi /tmp/<file>.txt e seguilo. <constraint>. report finale.'`, (b) slash command `/using-specialists`, (c) brief correction ≤3 sentences.

Prefer `xtmux safe-send-pointer` when available — it dry-runs first, rejects working targets, multiline payloads, shell substitution, and auto-appends the double-Enter that Claude Code panes require (Claude Code consumes the first Enter as paste-detection).

## Pre-flight checklist — before every first send-keys

```bash
tmux list-panes -t <session> -F '#{pane_id} #{pane_current_command}'
tmux show-options -p -t <pane_id> -qv @agent_state 2>/dev/null || true   # any working|running|busy|thinking = STOP
tmux capture-pane -t <session> -p | tail -15                              # live UI check
tmux display-message -t <session> -p '#{pane_current_path}'               # real cwd (name ≠ cwd)
```

Any check fails → STOP. Do not improvise; wait, switch session, or recreate. The pane's `@agent_state` and its visible UI are both authoritative; trust neither one alone.

## Session naming convention

`<orchestrator-session-name>-<topic-slug>` (e.g. `infra-audit-sweep`, `design-spec-rewrite`). Persistent main sessions (`design`, `infra`, `svc`) keep bare names. Specialist-spawned `sp-<role>-<hash>` follow the specialists CLI convention — leave alone. Collisions append `-2`, `-3`. Forbidden: `svc-s24f-tests`, `test-orch-xyz`, `tmp-investigation` — the convention is what makes `tmux ls` parseable.

## Operator-help patterns — quick routing

| Pattern | Trigger | Steps in brief |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Inventory | "what's running", "session map" | `xtmux dashboard sessions-only` → per-session `pane_current_path` + `@agent_state` + bead |
| 2 Assisted hand-off | "send task X to Y", "delegate to Y" | pre-flight Y → create bead → `xtmux handoff --target Y --bead <id>` (or /tmp file + `safe-send-pointer --yes`) → confirm → send |
| 2b Bare launch (no role) | general-purpose worker | `xt claude|pi <name> --no-attach --prompt '/<skill> leggi /tmp/<file>.txt e seguilo'` (mind the runtime's slash form — see gotcha above) |
| 3 Cleanup | "kill dead sessions", "clean orphans" | `xtmux audit` cleanup rows → `tmux kill-session` idle sessions with clean tree → `git worktree prune` → `sp clean --ps` |
| 4 Messy-run recovery | "went off-rails", "N spurious beads" | `tmux send-keys C-c` ×2-3 → close spurious beads → `bd remember` the trigger |
| 5 Multi-session goal | one outcome across N sessions | one epic bead → per-session child via `--parent` → hand off each via Pattern 2 → aggregate on close |
| 6 Sprint orchestration | full sprint w/ judge + DM + ordered merges | epic + per-worker children + `/pr-reviewer` judge pane + `/deploy-monitor` pane; DM mandatory on ANY infra-surface PR (prometheus.yml, alertmanager.yml, traefik/**, docker-compose, `.env`) regardless of size |
| 7 Coordinator sub-orchestrator | epic with many tracked tasks | `xt pi --role chain-coordinator --bead <epic> --no-attach` — coordinator absorbs monitoring; you see only its final report |

## Deploy-gap chain (Pattern 6 essential)

Between `gh pr merge` and DM opening a window: build → `docker compose up -d --force-recreate <svc>` → verify `docker inspect StartedAt > mergedAt` (or `scripts/verify-deploy-applied.sh` if bundled). DM refuses the window on stale artifact. Full doctrine in `/deploy-monitor`.

## Retrieval hierarchy

Before retrieving, gate on the target's live transition: `xtmux wait-agent <target> --wait-for-transition --consume --timeout <dur>` blocks until the pane/job state changes instead of a manual `capture-pane` live-state poll loop. It waits on **live pane state** and is **not durable retrieval** — after the wait returns, read the results from the durable sources below. `multiplexing-team` teaches the same primitive to delegated panes; this is the orchestrator-side equivalent.

Prefer durable sources over live scraping:

- `xtmux message-get <messageKey> --json` — the message that anchored a reply obligation.
- `xtmux agent-last <pane_id> --json` — last completed turn on a pane.
- `sp result <job-id> --json` — final specialist output.
- `tmux capture-pane` — **live-state only** (pre-flight `@agent_state` disagreement, wizards, transient UI). Never as final-result protocol.

## SQLite coordination — the short version

`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/xtmux/observability.db` is the sole source of truth for reply obligations and outbound waits. Beaded `message-send` defaults `--expects-reply=true`; FYI opts out with `--expects-reply=false`. Recipient preserves `messageKey`, `message-ack` = receipt, `message-reply --in-reply-to "$KEY"` = fulfilment (or `safe-send-pointer --reply-to "$KEY"` when pane injection is also required). Do not create/inspect/delete runtime marker files; restart recovery comes from SQL. Manual triage: `xtmux message-status "$KEY" --json`, `xtmux obligations list --pane "$MY_PANE" --json`, `xtmux monitor-list --json`.

## Failure / escalation trigger

Escalate to operator when: pre-flight can't be satisfied and the send is time-sensitive; a delegated agent produces off-contract output twice in a row after correction; two live sessions on the same worktree cause visible git-state races (recommend dedicated `xt claude`/`xt pi` worktree per session); `xtmux audit` warning rows require judgment calls the operator asked to keep in their hands.

## End-of-session hygiene

`tmux ls` → kill idle `<orchestrator>-*` with clean tree → `git worktree prune` on each repo → `sp clean --ps` → run `/session-close-report` if loaded.
