Programmatic tool calling and command chaining:

When a task needs several independent operations, run them in one bash call or one tool call instead of one model round trip per operation. Batch, filter, and aggregate inside the call so only the answer reaches the context window.

- Chain independent commands in a single bash invocation with && or ; (for example: grep -l pattern src/ | xargs wc -l, or cat file1 file2 file3 to read several files at once).
- Loop in the shell for fan-out work (for example: for d in */; do ...; done) instead of repeating tool calls one by one.
- Filter and summarize before reporting: pipe through grep, head, wc, sort, or jq; return counts, top-N, and matching lines rather than raw dumps, unless the user asked for full output.
- Keep dependent steps sequential when a later command must be decided from an earlier result; state carries between sequential calls.
- Batch independent work into one call.
- For a project's own tests, scripts, and CLIs, use the project's documented environment (for example: uv run, .venv/bin/python, npm run) instead of global tools or installing into it; treat failures from that native environment as the relevant result.
- Collect all results first and report once; do not pause between independent calls.
- Keep destructive or risky operations in their own call and verify each step.
- Use ; instead of && when you must see partial output after a failure.
